  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Propagation of false information have become a major concern in recent times. ​

A Microsoft survey suggests that 60% of Indians have come across fake news stories online, compared to the global average of 57%.​

Propagators of fake news may have different motives ranging from financial gains to political agendas​

There have been instances of fake news leading to violence reported across India​</p>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>People find it easier to consume news content online as compared to traditional sources thanks to ease of access and free content​

But, social medias such as Facebook are notorious for being purveyors of fake news​

There have been efforts to counter the fake news problem, but the effectiveness of such moves is questionable​</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p> classified data (fake or real) was collected from multiple sources, after pre processing, data was subjected to feature extraction techniques,extracted features were used to train machine learning algorithms. trained models can be used to further classify new data sets</p>

    <h2>Techniques used</h2>
      <h8>Data preprocessing techniques</h8>
       <ul>

    </div>
    <div id="result">
    <h2>Result</h2>
    
  <p>3 feature extraction techniques have been implemented, including Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, and Word2Vec​

Random Forest, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression have been used as classification models​

Support Vector Machine with TF-IDF showed the most promising results​

It achieved 93.6%, 93.7%, 93.7%, and 93.6% as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores respectively​</p>

    <div id="conclution">
    <h2>Conclution</h2>
  <p>Support Vector Machine with TF-IDF showed the most promising results in the project​

Fake news is a social evil, it can influence the minds of the readers.​

Propagators may use fake news for financial or political gains​

It is a threat to democracy​

Therefore, it is important that we build a system that is highly capable of labelling fake news as such and prevent it from spreading right from the start.​</p>
